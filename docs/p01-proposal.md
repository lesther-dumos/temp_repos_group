## **Abstract**
<p> The agenda of the project is to understand the differentiating social economic status play a role in the cultural norms in financial commitments. In order to approach this question, we will group the data by annual income showcasing common characteristics of each category of salary. The importance of this data is to outline the different resources used by groups corresponding to their annual income. </p>

## **Introduction**
In the alarming growth in the expenses of resources becoming expensive, we have decided to report a project based on the current economic situation. The limited resources being a concern after the hit of Covid-19 has created a global surge in prices. This was due to the result of political decisions and supply and demand of resources. Due to the current outcome, we have decide to create a project that reflects in the current trends and cultures in retrospective of the high living standards. The information provided in this report comes from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as well as [kraggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clkmuhammed/creditscoreclassification?resource=download) showcasing the information in the current work force. In addition of the information, we are hoping to showcase the changes and current work flow to the general public.


## **Problem Domain**
With the appearance of Covid-19, it lead to a drastic hit in the economy as many people lack security in their jobs due to companies insuring layoffs. Job growth remains slow, hours cut, instability in jobs, and overall lost in wages. The Census Bureau released data on the job market at the end of 2021, and it was noted that tens of millions of people lost their jobs ([CBPP](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-economys-effects-on-food-housing-and#:~:text=The%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic%20and,unemployment%20remained%20high%20throughout%202020.)). This had resulted in many relief programs being active. Nevertheless, 20 million households did not have enough to eat and 10 million being behind in house payments. The [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)] recorded the changes in major worker groups in September:


<br>

> 1) The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons decreased by 306,000 to 3.8 million in September
> 2) The number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was little changed at 5.8 million in September and remains above its February 2020 level of 5.0 million
> 3) Among the unemployed, the number of permanent job losers decreased by 173,000 to 1.2 million in September
> 4) The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, increased by 119,000 to 485,000 in September.

The pandemic impacted everyone but was not distributed evenly to all social classes. In fact, it remained more prevalent in groups such as Blacks, Latinos, and other groups of minority. This is the result due to structural racism shifting the most economic hardships to those of color.
> Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rate for Hispanics decreased to 3.8 percent in September. The jobless rates for adult men (3.3 percent), adult women (3.1 percent), teenagers (11.4
percent), Whites (3.1 percent), Blacks (5.8 percent), and Asians (2.5 percent) showed little change over the month

Into a more global setting, resources have increased due to the lack of production stemming from Covid-19.  The article *The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food price indexes and data collection* reported by
[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2020/article/the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-food-price-indexes-and-data-collection.htm)
Included that production of meats in Asia fell 9% in 2020. This lead to the declining of U.S. exports meat prices resulting in a drop of 22.5% in meat packaging. However, due to the meat shortage it caused in the increase of meat going up by 16%. As well as sea food experiencing chain disruptions causing in a decrease of production in fish and shellfish by 17.1%. The pandemic caused many businesses to halt and slow down production causing the demand to increase along with the prices.



## **Research Questions**

1) How has the the workforce in groups of minority been impacted?
<br> How does other groups compared in losses compared to mainstream groups? What resources were given to accommodate the standard of equity. It will give a visualization in which groups are being affected the most.

2) What are the current trends/culture of each standing social classes?
<br>In addition, what are the characteristics of other groups. What assets have increased and if they have taken a toll in their own finances. What they have earned/lost or maintained throughout the economy collapse. We are hoping to see which traits are involved with each social economic standing.

3) How did Covid-19 affected finance in the long term?
<br> Current resources such as gases and food have continued to rise and maintained at high levels. How has the global economy been affected in the presences of high demand and shortage of supplies. Along with real estate becoming expensive averaging nearly a 20% increase in rent within the US.

## **The Dataset**

The dataset details a lot of information related to finance specifically credit scores. It gives data related to credit score, SSN, occupation, individual base salaries and number of bank accounts a person has. All of this data is helpful to our project because it helps us see how credit scores differ based on socioeconomic status and one way to determine that is through knowing occupation.

<br>

The data was collected by Rohan Paris, a software developer at Cognizant. The dataset was updated about 4 months ago. The purpose of the set was to identify people’s credit scores with only occupation and minimal bank information given. It was funded through Kaggle. The people/organizations likely to benefit from the data would be Kaggle because there would be more interactions with their site and also people who generally want to learn more about the development of credit scores. We assume that Kaggle has measures that ensure their datasets are reliable and of quality, so yes it’s credible. We obtained the data by searching the kaggle site where the link was provided to us through the proposal instructions. We did credit the source.



## **Expected implications**
- The toll the COVID-19 pandemic has exacted on the global economy has been significant, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimating that median global GDP dropped by 3.9% from 2019 to 2020, making it the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. While the global economy was estimated to have recovered in 2021, recovery has been uneven and disparities in vaccine access and coverage could threaten improvement in much of the world.

- Majority of PEPFAR countries, GDP fell in 2020, the year the pandemic emerged, compared to 2019. In 11 countries, the contraction was greater than 10%. While PEPFAR countries experienced less of a median GDP drop than the global economy overall in 2020 (1.9% compared to 3.9%), they generally fared worse than their economic and regional peers.

- While the global economy was estimated to have recovered in 2021, this was not the case in PEPFAR countries. While almost all PEPFAR countries were estimated to have experienced some GDP growth in 2021, the projected growth, at least through 2024, remains below pre-pandemic projections (10-13% below). By contrast, the current projections of global GDP exceed the pre-pandemic projections. In addition, the challenges facing the global economy are likely to continue, particularly in low and middle-income countries, as the strong rebound in 2021 is expected to decelerate in 2022.

## **Limitations**
One thing that the data table fail to accommodate is the area of living. As some areas have low or high financial needs of living, it can have an effect on the statistics and general making decisions in
classifying the social classes. Data does lack a few information to find solutions for the problem domain. May have to find data that is more fitting.
